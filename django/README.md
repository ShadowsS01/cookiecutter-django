# Django Template

A simple Django template with cookiecutter

## Usage

First, get Cookiecutter.

```bash
pip install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"
```

Now run it against this repo:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/ShadowsS01/templates/tree/master/django
```

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you.

**Warning**: After this point, change 'My name', etc to your own information.

Answer the prompts with your own desired [options](./docs/project-generation-options.md). For example:

```bash
# output
```

Enter the project and take a look around:

```bash
cd your_project_slug
ls
```
